## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- I learned to dynamically generate an HTML card template on runtime with the help of an IIFE.
- I learned that if I think more and write less, my structure will improve.
- I learned that it's best to look up things rather than expect to have everything I'm going to need ready in my mind and spend time fixing my XY problems generating from that.
- I learned to break objectives down, maybe even spell them out for myself in a comment, to keep myself focused.
- I learned that I don't come up with a working solution, or the best soft coded solution just like that without hardcoding it beforehand. (at least not yet)
- I learned that inline SVG is the best SVG.
- I managed to find a place for my first _live_ logical switch statement.
- I learned more about breaking functions apart and categorizing them appropriately.
- I learned more about naming functions so they make sense.
- I used CSS selectors that I didn't use before much. (like `nth-of-type()`)
- I learned that `console.dir()` gives you the element in object form
- I learned more about how parameters work, it was like using props in React

### Continued development

I look forward to structuring my JS code better and using more of what SCSS has to offer.
Also to using the right HTML elements to improve accessibility. FrontendMentor's helping me with that a lot.
