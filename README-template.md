## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript"

### What I learned

- to scale inline svgs using the `zoom` property to modify the size
- to put a pseudo element (`::before`, `::after`) on the label to make reading in an svg through the `content` prop
- to use `setTimeout` when `element.click()` isn't working, even with 1ms, when no other way to dispatch a click event works that I only wanted to use for testing purposes, with an IIFE, to avoid going through the drill of completing the information by hand after every code change
