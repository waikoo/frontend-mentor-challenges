## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I have a better understanding of how to manually set up `@font-face` imports in my CSS, for different font weights for the same font-family.

I'm still in the process of optimizing classes to be able to batch-select elements based on styling intentions and not leaving any unused.

I'm getting more comfortable with JavaScript. There was a time when I would've written out individual styling in JS, instead of using group selectors and iterating over them.

### Continued development

I will continue to try out different ways of grouping and naming my classes in HTML/CSS to make it easy to style the elements.

I will search for better ways of selecting/storing my variables than the way it is now, just hanging in the global scope.
